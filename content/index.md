Hey there! I’m a 4th year Computer Science Student at UC Davis! I love making
OS-level tools, Discord Bots, and other fun projects such as this website. I
hope you enjoy your stay!

## Pinned Projects

Here are some of my pinned projects. I try my best to maintain them, and I'm
constantly looking for ways to improve them.

To see all my projects, check out the [Projects](./Projects/) tab or my
[Github repositories](https://github.com/zSuperx?tab=repositories).

### Custom Compression Tool

This is a custom compression program I wrote that's based on `bzip2`. I wrote
almost everything in this project from scratch in Rust. It currently has an
average compression rate of ~70% (on large files) and supports variable encoding
schemes.

Click [here](./Projects/compression.md) for more info.

### Wonderwall (Custom Wallpaper Engine)

When I first started using [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), I noticed that
tools like toolbars, wallpaper engines, notification daemons, etc were not
included by default. As a result, I created the Wonderwall wallpaper engine to
help manage Hyprland’s underlying wallpaper image setter
[Hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper).

### Demonify (Custom Systemd Manager)

As I got more into Raspberry Pi development, I wrote my own simple wrapper tool
to allow easy management of programs/commands to be run on startup. It works by
creating `.service` files that interact with Unix `systemd`.
