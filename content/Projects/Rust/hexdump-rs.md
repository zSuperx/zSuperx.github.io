title: Hexdump in Rust
---

[Project Link](https://github.com/zSuperx/hexdump-rust)

This repository is my submission to Professor Porquet's screening test for Lab C
(Educational OS in Rust).

## About

The original hexdump functionality that was mentioned in the doc was simply to
print the contents of a file in hex, with an optional `-n` flag to specify how
many bytes to print.

This functionality was achieved in the second commit of this repository, and can
be seen by viewing that commit and its code or by clicking
[here](https://github.com/piyushkumbhare/hexdump-rust/blob/9903da2fa5de0be99ad01463a7b11051df953f9f/src/main.rs).

When it comes to parsing arguments, I originally used `Clap`. However, while it
drastically simplifies the code and streamlines the process of parsing CLI
arguments, it was brought to my attention that kernel-level code should _avoid_
using non-`std` modules. Hence, I reverted the program back to using a manual
argument parser.

## Improvements / Features

After completing the core `hexdump` functionality along with the `-n` option, I
took it on as a challenge to implement more features as I saw fit.

Here is an updated `--help` menu, which displays all the features I added.

```
$ hexdump_rust.exe --help

hexdump: A tool used to print/format the bytes of an input file.

Usage: hexdump [OPTIONS] <FILE>

    -n <NUM>                    Total number of bytes to read.
    -w --width <NUM>            Number of bytes to print per line. (Default: 16)
    -c --chunk-size <NUM>       Number of bytes to print per space-separated chunk. (Default: 2)
    -s --start-offset <NUM>     Starting offset to read file from. (Default: 0)
    -t --translate              Enables in-line ASCII translation.
    -o --no-offset              Disables offset column.
    -h --help                   Prints this message.
```

I decided not to copy the real `hexdump`'s features exactly and instead took the
creative liberty to add ones that made sense and showcased Rust's power the
best. Many of the original `hexdump`'s features are still present, but have just
been generalized through different options/flags.

All added features mentioned above are working as intended and have tests to
ensure their functionality.

When it comes to error handling, we can use a nifty trick of having `main()`
returning a `Result` type. This way, Rust will automatically print the `Err`
type in the case of any failure:

```
$ hexdump_rust.exe not-a-file
Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "The system cannot find the file specified." }
error: process didn't exit successfully: `hexdump_rust.exe not-a-file` (exit code: 1)
```

```
$ hexdump_rust.exe example.bin -s 257
Error: LengthError { message: "Starting offset (257) was larger than the file length (256)" }   
error: process didn't exit successfully: `hexdump_rust.exe example.bin -s 257` (exit code: 1)
```

An added benefit of this approach is to allow us to utilize the `?` operator on
any `Result` type present within the code. This drastically cleans up the logic
and makes writing new code _much_ easier.

## Examples

Here are examples of the non-obvious features on the same file used in the
document:

```

(It's important to note that on some architectures, the `hexdump` command
reverses each "chunk" due to some processors using the little-endian convention
for 16-bit words. My implementation of the program does not do this, and instead
prints all bytes in order)

## Testing

This project can be tested via Cargo's built-in testing tool.

All tests are located within `tests.rs` and linted with the `#[test]` macro. To
run all tests, simply run `cargo test` and a detailed summary of the results
will be printed to the screen. All tests use `.bin` or `.txt` files located
within the root directory, so please ensure you pull these before running the
tests.

## Final Thoughts

I loved working on this project, as it tested my knowledge of Rust as well as
put me into the mindset of writing "kernel level" code. Writing my own Error
types and ensuring that the program should never fail unexpectedly was a fun
challenge to take on.

I may continue working on this project even after Professor Porquet's lab
applications close, so if you have any suggestions on features I should add or
coding conventions, please feel free to let me know!
